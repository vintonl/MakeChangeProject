## Make Change Project

### First project after week-one at Skill Distillery.

### Overview:

This program simulates a cash transaction to return the correct change for a cash purchase using US Dollars.

### How to run:

This program is designed to run as a Java method. The user will input the total amount of the transaction and the amount tendered by the customer. The program returns a message communicating the amount of change to return to the customer by the proper increments to return the fewest number of bills or coins.

### Technologies:

This program was written in Java using Eclipse. Additionally, I used Git and Github to post and share this program.

### Lessons learned:

I learned how to overcome working with a double by casting a rounded double to an integer and changing the decimal point.
